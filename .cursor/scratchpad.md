# Advanced Swap UI - Project Plan

## Background and Motivation

**Current State**: The project is currently a "panic button" application that allows users to liquidate all tokens to USDC in emergency situations. The UI is basic and functional but limited.

**New Vision**: Transform this into a sophisticated swap interface that improves upon existing DEXes like Uniswap by offering:
- Dual input modes (token quantity + USD denominated amounts)
- Bidirectional calculation (input target amount, auto-calculate source)
- Integrated market data (market cap, FDV) instead of external links
- Modern, intuitive UI inspired by Pendle's design patterns

**Business Value**: Create a best-in-class swap interface that provides superior UX compared to existing solutions, particularly in terms of input flexibility and integrated market data.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### 1. **Price Data Integration**
- Need real-time token prices for USD conversion
- Market cap/FDV data requires token supply information
- Rate limiting and API reliability considerations
- Caching strategy for price data

### 2. **Bidirectional Calculation Logic**
- Complex math for reverse calculations (output ‚Üí input)
- Handling slippage in reverse calculations
- Real-time quote updates as user types
- Debouncing API calls for performance

### 3. **State Management Complexity**
- Multiple input modes (quantity vs USD)
- Synchronizing four potential inputs (from quantity, from USD, to quantity, to USD)
- Managing which field is the "source of truth"
- Quote refresh timing and invalidation

### 4. **UI/UX Sophistication**
- Responsive design across devices
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Error handling and loading states
- Accessibility compliance

### 5. **API Integration Architecture**
- Monorail API for quotes and token data
- External price APIs for USD conversion
- Token metadata and market data sources
- Error handling and fallback strategies

**Ready for Phase 4!** The beautiful, functional swap interface is complete - just need transaction execution integration!

**Pending Questions for Human User**:
1. ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Price data will use Monorail's built-in APIs
2. Should we support fiat currencies beyond USD?
3. Any specific design preferences or brand colors to maintain?
4. Performance requirements (target load times, responsiveness)?

**Required Information**:
- Design system requirements or existing brand guidelines
- Target user base and device support requirements

**Price Data Architecture - CONFIRMED**:
- **MON/USD Rate**: `https://testnet-api.monorail.xyz/v1/symbol/MONUSD`
- **Token Pricing**: `https://testnet-api.monorail.xyz/v1/token/{ADDRESS}`
- **USD Calculation**: `mon_per_token * MON_USD_price = token_USD_price`
- **Confidence Indicator**: `pconf` field shows pool count (higher = more reliable)

*No lessons learned yet - project just starting*

## Technical Architecture Notes

### Proposed Tech Stack Additions
- **Price Data**: Monorail's unified API for token prices and MON/USD rates
- **State Management**: React Context + useReducer for complex swap state
- **UI Components**: Custom components inspired by Pendle's design
- **Caching**: localStorage for price cache with TTL
- **Debouncing**: lodash.debounce for API calls

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Single Source of Truth**: One input field drives all calculations at a time
2. **Price Caching**: 30-second cache for token prices to reduce API calls
3. **Unified API Strategy**: Use Monorail for both swap quotes and price data
4. **Price Confidence**: Display `pconf` values to users for transparency
5. **Mobile First**: Responsive design prioritizing mobile experience
